# Serverless Mailer

An experimental newsletter sender.

I fell in love with the concept of AWS Lambda and then I found this framework. Sadly, I had no experience with NodeJS, so I decided to start a small project with this framework and will write here all the lessons I learn.

The project goal is to build a platform that reads a RSS file every morning, generates a Newsletter and delivers it to hundred of users.

Let's browse the [wiki](https://github.com/luctus/serverless-mailer/wiki) to find all my lessons
